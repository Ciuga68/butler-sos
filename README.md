# butler-sos
Butler SenseOps Stats ("Butler SOS") is a Node.js service publishing operational Qlik Sense metrics to MQTT.
  
   

## Note
*No further development is expected on Butler SOS. It has been replaced by [Butler SOS/Influxdb](https://github.com/mountaindude/butler-sos-influxdb), which is a superset of Butler SOS. 
The difference is that Butler SOS/Influxdb saves all data from Qlik Sense's healthcheck API to Influxdb, in addition to sending the data out over MQTT.*
